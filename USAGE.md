# Introduction
Superdesk is an end-to-end news creation, production, curation, distribution and publishing platform. It is the pipeline that ideas and scoops go through to become published articles. The Triangle uses it as our production software, so all production processes are accomplished through Superdesk. It allows us to stay organized, automate things, and keep stuff clean on the technical side as well.
To learn about the basics of Superdesk, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ09P2Fz4Io&list=PLYCg0jl6TA9fuXCb2OIEQmFlVxCEXFY0S

# Production process
- Writers submit articles to their editors before production night
- Section editors do a first pass of edit suggestions
- Each article is sent to a baby copy editor
- Chief copy editor checks baby copys' edit suggestions and makes more
- Section editors do a second pass of edit suggestions
- Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editor split sections and do final edits

Photography has a separate process that the Media department documents itself. The Chief Visual Editor(s) upload photos at any point during the production process.

# Translating this to Desks and Stages
Each desk's members can create and edit content on that desk. However, anyone from any desk can peer in to see what is going on.
Example desk view:

- Section desks (there will be a separate one for each section)
  - Members of desk: that section's editor(s) and writers
  - `Authoring` stage that writers create articles in (or editors add submitted articles to)
  - `Editing` stage that writers send articles to, and that editors make suggested edits in, then send to copy editing desk (writers don't have permissions to send to another desk)
- Copy Editing desk
  - Members: essentially everyone in edboard. Chief copy editor, baby copy editors, and section editors (who are currently serving as baby copys)
  - `Baby Copy` stage. A baby copy opens an article to claim it, then sends it to chief copy's stage when they're done
  - `Chief Copy` stage
  - `Section Editor` stage, for second round edits
- Final Review desk
  - Members: EIC and Managing Editor
  - Just one `Final Review` stage. EIC and Managing Editor do their edits and accept/deny everyone else's edits
- Published (not an actual desk)
  - Goes to wordpress, needs to be scheduled manually by someone, can be IT Director(s), or Visual Editor(s) since they have to put in photos at some point anyways.
 
# Editing content
Watch the following video (which is set to timestamp 3:22) to learn the basics of the Superdesk content editor: https://youtu.be/-X9F6cFS0g8?t=212&si=eUBB40oq1zyzUDk4

At the Triangle, we have three types of content items:

## Standard article
- Sluglines are just for internal use while the article is in Superdesk
- Headlines are the actual title
- You can put in any author name you want, it won't check against any list like Wordpress used to
- Use the suggestions and comments features in the text editor, not on the right sidebar
- Abstract gets added onto body before everything else
- Editor's note gets added onto body after everything else
- Image(s) can be placed anywhere in body
- If a single image, it shows up as featured. idk with multiple
- Image description is put under the image, use it for usual credit/copyright line
