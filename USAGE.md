# Introduction
Superdesk is an end-to-end news creation, production, curation, distribution and publishing platform. It is the pipeline that ideas and scoops go through to become published articles. The Triangle uses it as our production software, so all production processes are accomplished through Superdesk. It allows us to stay organized, automate things, and keep stuff clean on the technical side as well.

To learn about the basics of Superdesk, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ09P2Fz4Io&list=PLYCg0jl6TA9fuXCb2OIEQmFlVxCEXFY0S

# Production process
- Writers submit articles to their editors before production night
- Section editors do a first pass of edit suggestions
- Each article is sent to a baby copy editor
- Chief copy editor checks baby copys' edit suggestions and makes more
- Section editors do a second pass of edit suggestions
- Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editor split sections and do final edits

Photography has a separate process that the Media department documents itself. The Chief Visual Editor(s) upload photos at any point during the production process.

# Translating this to Desks and Stages
Each desk's members can create and edit content on that desk. However, anyone from any desk can peer in to see what is going on. Having different members in different desks helps enforce some of the rules of the production process.

Example desk view:

![triangledesk_desk_view](https://github.com/DrexelTriangle/triangledesk/assets/35565054/a43f9802-0c13-4ab8-b948-dcc22f8ef8df)
- Section desks (there will be a separate one for each section)
  - Members of desk: that section's editor(s) and writers
  - `Authoring` stage that writers create articles in (or editors add submitted articles to)
  - `Editing` stage that writers send articles to, and that editors make suggested edits in, then send to copy editing desk
    - (writers don't have permissions to send content to a different desk, only a different stage)
- Copy Editing desk
  - Members: essentially everyone in edboard. Chief copy editor, baby copy editors, and section editors (who are currently serving as baby copys)
  - `Baby Copy` stage. A baby copy opens an article to claim it, then sends it to chief copy's stage when they're done
  - `Chief Copy` stage
  - `Section Editor` stage, for second round edits
- Final Review desk
  - Members: EIC and Managing Editor
  - Just one `Final Review` stage. EIC and Managing Editor do their edits and accept/deny everyone else's edits
  - This is the only desk that content can be published from.
- Published (not an actual desk)
  - Goes to wordpress, needs to be scheduled manually by someone, can be IT Director(s), or Visual Editor(s) since they have to put in photos at some point anyways.
 
# Editing content
Watch the following video (which is set to timestamp 3:22) to learn the basics of the Superdesk content editor: https://youtu.be/-X9F6cFS0g8?t=212&si=eUBB40oq1zyzUDk4

## Standard article
Here are the fields in a standard text article.

![image](https://github.com/DrexelTriangle/triangledesk/assets/35565054/802a7267-0860-4061-a08b-d3f8fc46a97e)
- Header fields
  - Mostly just for internal purposes while the article is still in Superdesk, and will not show up after it's published.
  - The `category` (i.e. section) should be autofilled to the correct one if you created your item in the correct desk.
  - `Editor's note` gets added onto body after everything else.
  - You can add relevant `keywords` so the article shows up better in search engines.

- Content fields
  - `Headline`s are the actual title
  - You can put any author name you want in `byline`, it won't check against any list like Wordpress used to
  - `Body HTML` is the main text of the article.
  - Use the suggestions feature in the text editor (not on the right sidebar) to suggest edits
  - ![image](https://github.com/DrexelTriangle/triangledesk/assets/35565054/03060f3b-1e7d-49fa-878a-69717bcd2afd)

- Moving
  - To move content to another desk or to publish it, press the purple `Send To` button:
  - ![triangledesk_send_to](https://github.com/DrexelTriangle/triangledesk/assets/35565054/755b051f-120d-4126-acd9-7a83c4e84fa4)
  - Make sure to correctly select both the Desk and Stage you want to move to
  - NEVER move to a stage named â˜ . Your article will be LOST FOREVER (not actually but it'll be a PITA)
  - ![triangledesk_move_desk](https://github.com/DrexelTriangle/triangledesk/assets/35565054/d2b7729a-4820-4ed7-82e2-be80d3770447)
  - When publishing, just add the `Triangle Website` to `Target Subscribers`. You shouldn't need to change anything else.

Tip: Open the editor in a new window for a less crowded screen. You might have to close the editor first if it's already open.

## Media (WIP)
- Image(s) can be placed anywhere in body, using the media button in the text editor
- If a single image, it shows up as featured. idk with multiple
- Image description is put under the image, use it for usual credit/copyright line
